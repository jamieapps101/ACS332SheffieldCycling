Requirements
1 General
  1.1 Should take input data in the form of crime statistics, accident rates,
  1.2 Should have a data set builder (D01S17) in order to collect data at the end of each simulation cycle
  1.3 Should have optional initial reconfiguration module to regenerate model statistics
    1.3.1 Should be disableable such that model can be re-run exactly as before
  1.4 Each agent day shall be executed per tick, with infomation being collected through the dataset builder per half tick
  1.5 Model shall simulate 1 day per week, for 52 weeks per year for 20 years. This gives 1040 days of simulated time.
  1.6 Policy options shall be clear outlined at start or program, and one or more options may be selected to be simulated
    1.6.1 The policy of more cycle routes shall be implimented
      1.6.1.1 This shall be done by setting the Perceived Travel Safety Metric to 0.9 and increasing journey distance by a constant factor
    1.6.2 The policy of mode dedicated cycle road space shall be implimented
      1.6.2.1 This shall be done by increasing the Perceived Travel Safety Metric by a factor
    1.6.3 The policy of pay per use electric bikes shall be implimented
      1.6.3.1 This shall be done by reducing negaive impact on hill choice to 0, but increasing cost function
2 Model
  2.1 Shall have a temporal events function
    2.1.1 Temporal events shall include seasonal effects eg seasonal effects
    2.1.2 Temporal events shall include random events eg accidents, road works
    2.1.3 Temporal event may include localised illness/illness-transmission
    2.1.4 Temporal events may include progression of tecnology improvine road safety perception
  2.2 Should take account of location in city via spatial modelling
  2.2 Should take input data in the form of crime statistics, accident rates,
3 Agent
  3.1 Agents shall be configureable to represent cyclists and non-cyclists
  3.2 Agents shall have a fitness/willingness-to cycle metric
    3.2.1 This will be affected by seasonal changes
    3.2.2 This shall reperesent pre-disoposition to exercise (based on gausian distriution).
  3.3 Agents shall have an illness metric
  3.1 Shall have set home location and work location
    3.1.1 These shall be set in inital configuration such that they are constant through the model
    3.1.2 These shall have x,y,z coordinates, to map locations in 2D map, as well as to include altiude information
  Shall have path summation function
  3.1 Shall have Perceived Travel Safety Metric
    3.1.1 Metric based on local crime stats, percived accidents, path summation function
    3.1.2 feedback data including percived accidents shall be sampled and recalculaed for each agent per half tick
  3.2 Shall have Socio-economic status metric
    3.2.1 Socio-eoconomi status metric shall be based on living location
  3.3 shall have decision making process (DM) based on PTS metric, temporal events, exercise predisposition
    3.3.1 DM may also include illness, random variation
    3.3.2 DM shall be based on a fuzzy logic reasoning system
    3.3.3 DM outpud shall be a crisp decision to either cycle to work or to not cycle
    3.3.4 DM shall only model on journey in the day
